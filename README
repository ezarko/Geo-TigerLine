NAME
    Geo::TigerLine - TIGER/Line geographic data

DESCRIPTION
    This is a module around the TIGER/Line geographic data generated by the
    U.S. Census. TIGER/Line data files contain detailed information about
    roads, waterways, political and property boundaries, street addresses,
    etc... Almost (but not quite) everything you need to recreate something
    like Mapquest.

    Geo::TigerLine has been updated to reflect the structure of the 2006
    TIGER/Line data sets. If you want to use older datasets, consider
    regenerating the TIGER/Line data set parsers with the mk_parsers script
    distributed with this module.

BUGS, CAVEATS and Other Musings
    Seeing as how TIGER is trademarked, we might want to call this module
    something else.

ALL PRAISE TO
    Bruce Perens, for putting the Census Bureau in the position of realizing
    that they would be better off distributing this data themselves, for
    free, over the web. Ain't America grand? ;-)

SEE ALSO
    TIGER/Line data, manuals and additional info can be had from
    http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/. The TIGER/Line data itself is
    probably most easily downloaded from http://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/.

    See <Geo::Coder::US(3pm)>, a Perl module for mapping US street address
    to geographic coordinates, for one practical application based on
    Geo::TigerLine.
